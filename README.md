[You can also check my other demos](https://github.com/andrerferrer/dedemos/blob/master/README.md#ded%C3%A9mos).

## What needs to be done?

### 1. Add the migrations

We it's a N:N relationship, so, we need to have a join table.

The steps are:
#### 1.1. Create the Tags
```ruby
```
#### 1.2. Create the Join table
```ruby
```
#### 1.3. Add validations and associations
```ruby
```

And we're good to go ðŸ¤“
